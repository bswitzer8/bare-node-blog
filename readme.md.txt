1. Walk us through the design of your project. Why did you design your project the way you did? What difficulties did you overcome?

I tried to design it very modular and light weight. I kept it simple, I utilized the routes to pull in the Comments and Posts CRUD handles from there. Then, I made it so that there was some checking in the Comments/Posts functions that made sure the Comment or Post existed before it modified/deleted/updated it.

2. How did you test your project to verify that it works? If you used any specific curl requests, let us know.
POSTMAN! Best way to test, I made 8 request. 1 for each type on Posts/Comments.

3. Let us know if anything doesn't work as intended so your reviewers will know ahead of time
Everything works as expected, that's for sure.
